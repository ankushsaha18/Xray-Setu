### [Live Demo](https://xray-setu-app.vercel.app) | [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k1fur3WzxgE3iwJYAswXxWi4q6gj_cGU/view?usp=sharing) | [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data)

A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for analyzing chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia and aid COVID-19 diagnosis. Built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Kaggle Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset (~5,000 images), achieving 89.9% accuracy. Features a full-stack architecture with Next.js, Django, TensorFlow, and PostgreSQL, supporting drag-and-drop uploads, patient vitals input, and detailed diagnostic reports. Includes demo and integrated BE modes for seamless UX. Developed as a course project at Cairo University, rivaling graduation project quality.

This semi-graduation project demonstrates a clean architecture approach with three distinct service layers (Frontend, Backend, and AI Analysis) that work together to provide a comprehensive medical diagnostic tool.

## 🏗 Architecture

The application follows a modern client-server architecture with a clean separation of three distinct service layers:

1. **Frontend Service**: 
   - Built with Next.js 15.3, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
   - Handles user interface, interactions, and data visualization
   - Provides responsive design for various devices and clinical settings
   - Features interactive heatmap visualization of X-ray regions of interest
   - Includes light/dark mode for different working environments
   - Implements comprehensive form validation and error handling
   - Supports downloadable diagnostic reports in PDF format

2. **Backend Service**: 
   - Developed with Django 4.2, Python 3.12, and Django REST Framework
   - Manages API endpoints, authentication (JWT-based), and user management
   - Handles image processing and metadata extraction
   - Provides secure data storage and retrieval
   - Implements clinical data validation and processing
   - Offers comprehensive error handling and logging

3. **AI Analysis Service**: 
   - Integrates deep learning models for chest X-ray pathology detection
   - Analyzes images for conditions like pneumonia, COVID-19, cardiomegaly, etc.
   - Incorporates rule-based systems for diagnostic refinement using patient vitals
   - Generates heatmaps highlighting regions of interest in X-rays
   - Provides severity classification (Low, Moderate, High) based on findings
   - Delivers evidence-based treatment recommendations
   - Supports multiple diagnosis possibilities with confidence scores

Each layer has clear responsibilities and communicates through well-defined interfaces:
