## Confusion Matrix
```
[[5 3]
 [0 8]]
```

### Interpretation:
- **True Negatives** (Normal correctly identified): 5
- **False Positives** (Normal incorrectly classified as Pneumonia): 3
- **False Negatives** (Pneumonia incorrectly classified as Normal): 0
- **True Positives** (Pneumonia correctly identified): 8

## Analysis

The model shows good performance with the following characteristics:

1. **High Sensitivity for Pneumonia Detection**: 
   - 100% recall for pneumonia means the model correctly identifies all pneumonia cases
   - This is crucial for medical diagnosis to minimize false negatives

2. **Perfect Precision for Normal Cases**:
   - 100% precision for normal cases means when the model predicts normal, it's always correct

3. **Room for Improvement**:
   - The model has some false positives (3 normal cases classified as pneumonia)
   - Overall accuracy of 81.25% is good but could be improved with more training

## Recommendations

1. **Collect More Data**: Increasing the dataset size could improve overall accuracy
2. **Adjust Decision Threshold**: The current threshold is 0.5, but it could be optimized for better balance
3. **Further Training**: Additional epochs might improve performance on the normal class
4. **Data Quality**: Ensure high-quality, diverse X-ray images for both classes
